## ‚ú® Features

- **Network Discovery**: Automatically scans and identifies all devices on your local network
- **Device Identification**: Determines device types, manufacturers, and hostnames
- **Connection Analysis**: Monitors active network connections and associated processes
- **Bandwidth Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of network interface bandwidth usage
- **Latency & Packet Loss**: Continuous measurement of network reliability metrics
- **Internet Connectivity**: Monitors connection stability and outage detection
- **DNS Resolution**: Tests and monitors DNS performance
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Identifies abnormal network behavior and bandwidth spikes
- **Network Health Analysis**: Provides comprehensive assessment of overall network health
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Suggests improvements based on detected issues

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Works on macOS and Linux (some features may be limited on other platforms)
- Standard system utilities: ping, arp, netstat, lsof, ps

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-monitor.git
   cd network-monitor
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_monitor.py
   ```

3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install ipaddress
   ```

## üíª Usage

Run the network monitor with default settings:

```bash
./network_monitor.py
```

With custom parameters:

```bash
./network_monitor.py --network 192.168.1.0/24 --interval 5
```

### Command-line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--network` | `-n` | Network to scan (CIDR notation, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) |
| `--interval` | `-i` | Interval between connectivity checks in seconds (default: 10) |
| `--bandwidth-interval` | `-b` | Interval between bandwidth measurements in seconds (default: 2) |
| `--latency-interval` | `-l` | Interval between latency measurements in seconds (default: 30) |
